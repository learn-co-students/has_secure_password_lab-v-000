[x] Create a User model and migrations.

[] Create a Users controller. 
	[] It should respond to `new` with the signup form, and 
	[] respond to `create` by creating a new user.

[] Create a Sessions controller and the appropriate actions.

[] Create a user homepage. You can either 
	[] create a controller for it (a `WelcomeController` is a reasonable thing that you'll see frequently), or 
	[] you can make it an action in the User's controller.
